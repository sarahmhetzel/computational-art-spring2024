## Five Interconnected Aspects:
1. The steering force of the fish in scene one is related to the distance of any fish to those close to it. This is done through a combination of the forces alignment and separation. The same interconnection is used in scene 3 for the angler fish, as their movement is based on one another through alignment and separation. 
2. The hue of the color and the rotation of the coral are both related to frame count in all three underwater scenes.
3. The position of the particle bubbles in scene one are related to the force of the current under water. In the past this force has been called wind, but in this project I changed it to current to match the setting. 
4. The movement of the webcam pixels in the opening scene is related to sin and cosin curves for the x and y values of the pixels. This causes the image to sway like it is underwater. 
5. The position of the particle systems for the ink is interconnected with the octopus vehicles, because the position of the particle systems relates to the position of the octopus. 

## Multimedia:
1. Images are used for the backgrounds of each scene, each of the different kinds of fish, the submarine window in the opening scene,the bubble particles in scene 1, and the ink particles in scene 2.
2. A sound sample and the PolySynth are used to create the song that is playing in the background after the first mouse click. 
3. The webcam of the viewer is used in the opening scene as the image that can be seen through the submarine window. 
4. Text is used in the opening scene as introductory information. 
5. Primitive drawing functions such as line, ellipse, etc. are used in all other elements of the sketch.
